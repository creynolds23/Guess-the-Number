# Overview
As a computer engineer seeking to learn the Java programming language, I have created a Java application to demonstrate and explore various aspects of the Java language. This project focuses on implementing a Number Guessing Game with different difficulty levels and a high score tracking system. This project assisted with gaining hands-on experience with Java, practicing object-oriented programming in Java, learning about a Java data structure like lists, and creating a simple console-based game in Java.

# Development Environment
* Java: Primary programming language for writing the application
* Visual Studio Code IDE: Used as the integrated development enironment for coding, debugging, and testing
* GitHub: Version control and repository management for tracking project changes

# Useful Websites
* [Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)

# Future Work

Even though this project provided me with many learning experiences, there are some items for future improvement which include:
* Implementing a graphical user interface 
* Instead of just showing the highscore for the session, track highscores using save and load score options
* Extending the game with additional gameplay modes
